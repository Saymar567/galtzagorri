GALTZAGORRI DENDA
Hi there! This is a simple project I've made with other teammates.
- It is a full-stack web app done with Spring. Tools used:
- MySQL Driver (to connect the project with MySQL DB).
- JPA (Java Persistence API) -> Using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to transform objects into tables in the DB.
- Spring Web + SpringBoot Dev tools -> to create RESTful API (to do the CRUD operations).
- Thymeleaf -> to render dynamic HTML pages in Java.

You can do the CRUD operations connecting with a relational DB, which is MySQL.
